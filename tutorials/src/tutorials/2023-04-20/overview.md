# First BRANE tutorial at ICT.OPEN
The first tutorial that introduced users to the BRANE framework is given at [ICT.OPEN 2023](https://ictopen.nl/), a conference aiming to bring academia and industry together. Its purpose is to have users experience the role as a software engineer and scientist in the framework, mainly to develop an understanding of how working with the framework looks like in practise.

The tutorial is written for framework version [2.0.0](https://github.com/epi-project/brane/tree/v2.0.0).

The tutorial consists of the following parts:
- **12:30**-**12:45**: Introduction _(presentation)_
- **12:45**-**13:30**: Part1: Hello, world! _(guided hands-on)_
- **13:30**-**13:45**: Break
- **13:45**-**14:15**: Part 2: A workflow for Disaster Tweets _(hands-on)_
