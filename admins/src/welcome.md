Welcome to the administrator guide for the Brane infrastructure!

In this book, we document and outline how to set the _Brane framework_ up and how to manage it.

In contrast to the other books ([Brane: The User Guide](http://server.timinc.nl/brane) and [Brane: A Specification](http://server.timinc.nl/brane_specification)), this book assumes you are already familiar with the framework. If not, we recommend you to read the [specification](http://server.timinc.nl/brane_specification) to get an in-depth grasp of the framework and which services are involved with it.

To begin, you should first try to install a local version of Brane. How to do so is explained in [the first chapter](./installation/local-install.md).
