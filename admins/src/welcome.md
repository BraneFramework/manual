Welcome to the administrator guide for the Brane infrastructure!

In this book, we document and outline how to set the _Brane framework_ up and how to manage it.

In contrast to the other books ([Brane: The User Guide](/user-guide) and [Brane: A Specification](/specification)), this book assumes you are already familiar with the framework. If not, we recommend you to read (at least the introduction of) the [specification](/specification) to get a grasp of the framework and which services are involved with it.

To begin, go to the [next chapter](./installation/introduction.md), which introduces the installation process of the framework.
