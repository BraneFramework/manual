# Introduction
In this chapter, we will give a brief overview of the installation process of the framework.

There are three steps to installing the framework:
- Obtain the relevant binaries (either by downloading them from the repository or by compiling them yourself)
- Define initial infrastructures
- Create the images, either for local use or for deployment on a Kubernetes cluster and run the instance

After that, the framework is up-and-running. To use it, refer to the [Brane: The User Guide](/user-guide) book to learn how to work with it.

To start, the first step of the process is detailled in the [next chapter](./get-binaries.md).
