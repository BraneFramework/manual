Welcome to the Brane wiki!

This site is split into three sub-sites, each with its own purpose:
- [Brane: The User Guide](./user-guide.html) is aimed at the users of the framework. It documents how to setup a framework as an system administrator, how to write packages on BraneScript or Bakery as a software engineer and how to write workflows as a scientist. Basically, if you are using Brane as a finalized program, this is the documentation for you.
- [Brane: A Specification](./specification.html) is the book for those who are intending to develop the framework or who want to know how it works. It documents the framework's internal workings, as well as provides a specification for how services communicate so they may be replaced by custom software running on the individual domains (hence it being a framework). In general, if you will be doing development about some part of the framework, you should start here.
- [Brane Code Documentation](./docs.html) is the documentation for the code itself. It's not really meant to be read from top to bottom, like the other books, but rather as a reference during development on existing code.

If you are developing or running Brane on a non-Linux or non-x86_64 machine, it might make sense to generate the documentation yourself instead; check [cargo doc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-doc.html).

You can click on any of the links here or in the sidebar (to the left) to go to the resource of your choosing.
