# First BRANE tutorial at ICT.OPEN
The first tutorial that introduced users to the BRANE framework is given at [ICT.OPEN 2023](https://ictopen.nl/), a conference aiming to bring academia and industry together. Its purpose is to have users experience the role as a software engineer and scientist in the framework, mainly to develop an understanding of how working with the framework looks like in practise.

The tutorial is written for framework version [2.0.0](https://github.com/epi-project/brane/tree/v2.0.0).

The tutorial consists of the following parts:
- **09:00**-**09:15**: Introduction to the framework (presentation)
- **09:15**-**10:00**: Setup/Writing a simple package (hands-on)
- **10:00**-**10:15**: Break
- **10:15**-**10:45**: Writing a simple workflow (hands-on)
- **10:45**-**11:00**: Evaluation (both about the framework and the tutorial)
