# Brane Demo at the UMC Utrecht
The second tutorial given about Brane was held at the UMC Utrecht to conclude a Proof-of-Concept performed with them, which focused on Brane serving as data sharing infrastructure for various analysis on pseudonamised patient data.

The tutorial is written for framework version [3.0.0](https://github.com/epi-project/brane/tree/v3.0.0).

The demo is split in two halves: the first half consists of a presentation introducing the framework at a generic SIG-meeting, whereas the second half features a hands-on session and a more technical presentation about the setup of Brane in the Proof-of-Concept.

The following resources are used, which are hosted on this website:
- _First half: SIG-meeting_

- _Second half: Workshop_
    - Slides (to-be-added)
    - Handout for hands-on part of the tutorial ([here](./hello_world.md))
