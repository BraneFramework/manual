# Web Services & Cloud-Based Systems 2023
The Web Services and Cloud-Based Systems course was part of the joint [Computer Science programme](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/computer-science/computer-science.html) at the [University of Amsterdam](https://uva.nl) and [Vrije Universiteit](https://vu.nl).

The version of the framework used in the course was [2.0.0](https://github.com/epi-project/brane/tree/v2.0.0).
