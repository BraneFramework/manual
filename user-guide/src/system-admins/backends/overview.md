- A _local_ backend schedules new jobs on the same [Docker](https://docker.com) engine where the control plane of Brane runs. This is the simplest infrastructure of them all, and requires no other preparation than required when installing the control plane. This is typically the choice of backend when the worker node is running on a single server or VM.
- A _VM_ backend uses an SSH connection (via the [Xenon](https://github.com/xenon-middleware/xenon) middleware) to launch jobs on the Docker engine of another server or VM. This is typically useful for simple setups that still emphasise a split between a local control plane and a local compute plane, but don't have extensive clusters to connect to. 
- A _Kubernetes_ backend connects to a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster on which incoming jobs are hosted. This is the recommended option if you need larger compute power, since Kubernetes is designed to work with containers.
- A _Slurm_ backend connects to a [Slurm](https://www.schedmd.com/) cluster on which incoming jobs are hosted. This infrastructure type may be harder to setup, as Slurm does not have any builtin container support. However, when setup properly, it can be used to connect to existing large-scale compute clusters to execute Brane jobs on.
