# Introduction
In these chapters, we will walk you through installing a node in the Brane instance.

There are two types of nodes: a _central node_, or _control node_, and a _worker node_ (see the generic [introduction](../introduction.md) chapter). These series of chapters will discuss how to install both of them.

First, for any kind of node, you should start by [downloading the dependencies](./dependencies.md) on the VM where your worker node will run. Then, install the [`branectl`](./branectl.md) executable, which will help you in setting up and managing your node.

You can then go into the specifics for each kind of node. You can either setup a [control node](./control-node.md), or a [worker node](./worker-node.md).
