# Framework management
In these chapters, we will discuss how to setup and manage the Brane framework. It is mostly aimed at the system engineers in charge of running the framework control node(s), but this can also be a good place for if you want to run and play with the framework locally.

To learn how to locally install the framework on a single node or on your local machine for testing (that is, the framework itself; it is still possible to run workloads on remote nodes), refer to the [local installation](./local-install.md) chapter. To install the framework running over multiple nodes, check the [distributed installation](./distributed-install.md) chapter. This chapter also covers how to setup your machine so the control nodes may be reached from the outside.

To build the framework from source, check the [building from source](./build-from-source.md) chapter. This will result in the binaries that are needed to install the framework as discussed in the other two chapters.
