# Configuration files for users
In this chapter, you can find an overview of the configuration files for software engineers and scientists.

There are other configuration files in BRANE, but these are for use of administrators of nodes and instances. You can find those [here](../admins/introduction.md), or check the sidebar to the left.

In addition, there are a few configuration files that are present on the user's machine, but only relevant for the framework itself. These are discussed in [the specification](TODO).

The following configuration files are relevant for users of the framework:
- [`container.yml`](./container.md): A **YAML** file that defines the metadata of a BRANE package.
- [`data.yml`](./data.md): A **YAML** file that defines the metadata of a BRANE dataset.
