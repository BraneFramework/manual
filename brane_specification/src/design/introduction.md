# Introduction
In these few chapters, we will discuss why the framework is designed the way it is and what kind of generic features we want to implement. It is meant to give a proper background to what the framework can do before we begin with the explanation on how it works.

We will also establish some important terminology and names for parts of the design that will be re-used in later chapters.

In the [requirements](./requirements.md) chapter, we will first list the requirements that the Brane framework has and the challenges that come around when we try to implement them. Then, in the [capabilities](./framework-capabilities.md) chapter, we will list the capabilities that the framework should have to be able to adhere to the given requirements.
