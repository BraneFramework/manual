# Brane - The User Guide

> Warning: This book is still in development. Everything is currently subject to change

Welcome to the user guide for the Brane infrastructure!

In this book, we document and outline how to use the Brane framework from a user perspective. It is aimed at three different roles that the framework is build to accomodate: **system engineers**, **software engineers** and **scientists**. This separation is referred to throughout the book as the _separation of concerns_.

We recommend you start at the [overview](./overview.md) chapter, where we describe the general functionality of the framework and discuss more in-depth what this separation of concerns entails.

If you're eager to start, however, refer to the quick installation chapter for your role in the sidebar to setup the framework for you to start with it. If you do, it might be useful to have the [how to read](./how-to-read.md) chapter open in a new tab to be able to reference to the Brane-specific terms used throughout the document.
