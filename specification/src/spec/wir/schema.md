# Toplevel schema
In this chapter, we will discuss specification for the toplevel part of the WIR. Its sub-parts, the [graph representation](./graph.md) and [edge instructions](./instructions.md), are discussed in subsequent chapters.

Regardless of which you read, we will start with stating a few [conventions](#conventions) for how to read the specification. Then, this chapter will continue with the toplevel schema.


## Conventions
For clarity, we specify the WIR as [JSON](https://json.org). To refer to JSON types, we will use the terminology from the [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core.html) specification.
