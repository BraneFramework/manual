# Introduction
In the High-level design chapters, we will present the high-level design of the framework. Specifically, we discuss what is defined in the specification and what is left up for implementation by domains in the framework.

For any specifics on implementing software adherent to the specification, you should refer to the [Framework specification](../spec/introduction.md) chapters. Further, it is advisable to read the [Design requirements](../requirements/introduction.md) chapters first to contextualise the design explained here.


## Conventions
Throughout these chapters, we will occassionally make callbacks to the [assumptions and requirements](../requirements/requirements.md) specified in the [Design requirements](../requirements/introduction.md) series.

For example, you may see a particular sentence be postfixed by something like either ([Appendix A2](../requirements/requirements.md#assumption-a2)), to refer to an assumption, or ([Requirement B1](../requirements/requirements.md#requirement-b1)), to refer to a requirement. These callbacks are meant to motivate why a particular design decision was made by referring to the assumption or requirement allowing or requiring the decision, respectively.


## Next
To start with the design, read the [Bird's-eye view](./bird_eye.md)-chapter first, which provides the global picture best kept in mind when thinking about Brane. If you are already familiar with this, you can skip ahead to the specifics of a particular topic: simply select the chapter that picques your interest in the sidebar to the left, or start at [TODO](TODO) and read them sequentially.

Alternatively, if you are interested in the implementation, you can also read the [Framework specification](../spec/introduction.md) chapters, or visit the [Appendix](../appendix/overview.md) for information on tools around Brane.
