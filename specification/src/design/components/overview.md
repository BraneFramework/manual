# Components
In subsequent chapters, we will describe the functionality and behaviour of the individual (conceptual) components in the Brane framework.

Note that this is a high-level description of what the components should do. In the [Implementation](../../implementation/introduction.md) chapters, we elaborate on this view by how it's actually implemented.

The following components are discussed:
{{#include ../snippets/central_services.md}}
{{#include ../snippets/worker_services_brane.md}}
{{#include ../snippets/worker_services_tp.md}}
