# Design requirements
In this series of chapters, we present the main context for Brane: its rationale, the setting and use-case for which it is developed and, finally, the design restrictions and requirements for designing it.

First, in the [background](./background.md) chapter, the context and rationale of Brane is explained. Then, we discuss the setting and [use-case](./use_case.md) of Brane, which then allows us to state a set of restrictions and [requirements](./requirements.md) for its design.

If you are eager to read to how Brane actually works, you can also skip ahead to the [design](../design/introduction.md) series of chapters.
