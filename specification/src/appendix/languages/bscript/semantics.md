# Semantics
In this chapter, we examine the semantics behind the statements syntactically defined in the [Abstract syntax](./syntax.md) chapter. If the previous chapter guides towards the implementation of parsing BraneScript, this chapter explaines how to interpret the tree.

If you are interested in what BraneScript can be instead of what it is now, refer to the [Future work](./future.md) chapter instead.

First, we will provide necessary context for understanding the semantics, which revolves around the execution context. Next, we introduce the semantics behind the expressions, after which we move to the statements.


## Execution context
To execute BraneScript as specified in this chapter, a few features are required of the execution environment. We will detail these first.

First, BraneScript statements are processed in-order.
