# The control plane
In the [previous chapter](./toplevel-design.md), we discussed the Brane framework's general overview, including the separation of the Brane instance into a control plane and a compute plane. In this chapter, we will discuss the layout of the control plane.


## Layout
The control plane is arguably the most important part of the Brane framework. Most of its functionality can be traced to here, just like most of its complexity.
