- The [_backend_](/specification/design/components/backend.md) is the compute infrastructure that can actually execute tasks and process datasets. Conceptually, every domain only has one, although in practise it depends on the implementation of the worker. However, they are all grouped as one location as far as the planner is concerned.
- The [_data sources_](/specification/design/components/data_source.md) are machines or other sources that provide the actual data on which the tasks are executed. Their access is mostly governed by checkers, and they can supply data in many forms. From a conceptual point of view, every data source is a dataset, which can be given as input to a task - or gets created when a task completes to represent an output.
