- The [_driver_](/specification/design/components/driver.md) acts as both the entrypoint to the framework from a user's perspective, and as the main engine driving the framework operations. Specifically, it takes a workflow and traverses it to emit a series of events that need to be executed or otherwise processed to the domains.
- The [_planner_](/specification/design/components/planner.md) takes a workflow submitted by the user and attempts to resolve any missing information needed for execution. Most notably, this includes assigning tasks to domains that should execute them and input to domains that should provide them. However, this can also include translating internal representations or adding additional security. Finally, the planner is also the first step where policies are consulted.
- The [_global audit log_](/specification/design/components/glog.md) keeps track of the global state of the system, and can be inspected both by global components and local components (the latter is not depicted in the figure for brevity).
