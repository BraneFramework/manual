- The [_worker_](/specification/design/components/worker.md) acts as a local counterpart to the global driver. It takes events emitted by the driver and attempts to execute them locally. An important function of the worker is to consult various checkers to ensure that what it does it in line with domain restrictions on data usage.
- The [_checker_](/specification/design/components/checker.md) is the decision point where a domain can express restrictions on what happens to data they own. At the least, because of [Assumption B4](/specification/requirements/requirements.md#assumption-b4), the checker enforces its own worker's behaviour; but if other domains are well-behaved, the checker gets to enforce their workers too. As such, the checker must also reason about which domains it expects to act in a well-behaved manner.
- The [_local audit log_](/specification/design/components/llog.md) acts as the local counterpart of the global audit log. As the global log keeps track of the global state, the local log keeps track of local state; and together, they can provide a complete overview of the entire system.
