# Overview
In this chapter, we discuss the main operations of the Brane VM.

Note that we mostly focus on the global operations, and not on how specific [`Edge`](../../spec/wir/graph.md#edges)s or [`EdgeInstr`](../../spec/wir/instructions.md#edgeinstrs)uctions of the [WIR](../../spec/wir/introduction.md) are executed. Those are implemented as discussed in the WIR specification (mostly).
