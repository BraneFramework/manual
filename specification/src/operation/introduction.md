# How it works
This series of chapters deep-dives into all the processes of Brane and how they work.

In this series, we treat the following topics:
- [Workflows](./workflows/introduction.md): How the BraneScript and Bakery language parser works, how workflows are represented and how the framework maps between them.

If you want to understand the framework's operation top-to-bottom, you can go to the [next chapter](./workflows/introduction.md) and start reading about Workflows. Otherwise, follow any of the links in the list above to learn more about a particular topic.
