# BraneScript Workflows
In these chapters, we will discuss what it means to write a workflow, and how BraneScript can help you to do this.

In the [first chapter](./highlevel.md), we will discuss what it is that we exactly try to model with BraneScript. To this end, we will go in a bit more depth on workflows, and discuss the example that we will spend untangling for the rest of this series.

In the [second chapter](./calling-functions.md), we will discuss calling the external functions in BraneScript, which is arguably the most elementary yet useful operation that can be done. Then, in the [third chapter](./variables.md), we will discuss variables, after which we will treat control flows statements in the [fourth chapter](./control-flow.md). Finally, we will discuss the notion of Data in Brane, after which you will have completed you brief BraneScript bootcamp.

Note that this tutorial is not meant to give you a complete overview of BraneScript. Instead, it will teach you the most important concepts for writing most workflows. If you are eager to learn about all of its features, consider checking the [extended tutorial]({{ specification_root }}/appendix/languages/bscript/introduction.html) in the chapters on BraneScript itself, or even consult the [language specification]({{ specification_root }}/appendix/languages/bscript/introduction.html) in the [Brane: A Specification]({{ specification_root }}) book.
