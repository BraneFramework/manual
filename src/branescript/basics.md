# Basic concepts

In the [previous chapter](./workflow.md), we discussed your first "Hello, world!"-workflow. In this chapter, we will extend upon this, and go over the basic language features of BraneScript. We will talk about things like variables, if-statements and loops, parallel statements and builtin-functions.

More complex features, such as arrays, function definitions, classes or Data and IntermediateResults, are left to the next few chapters.

## Variables

First things first: how do variables work in BraneScript?

They work like in most languages, where you can think of a variable as a single memory location where we can store some information. Similarly to most languages, it can be used to store a single _object_ only; e.g., we can only store a single number, string or other value in a single variable[^arrays].

Variables are also _typed_, i.e., a single variable can only store values of the same type. While in some low-level languages, such as C or Rust, this is necessary to be able to compute the size of the variable, BraneScript only implements this for the purpose of being able to do _static analysis_: it can tell you beforehand whether the correct types are passed to the correct variables, which will help to eliminate mistakes made before you run a potentially lengthy workflow.

Finally, unlike other languages such as Python, BraneScript has an explicit notion of _declaration_: there is a difference between _creating_ a new variable and _updating_ it. This is also done to make static analysis easier, since the compiler can explicitly know which variables exist and how to analyse them.

So, how can we use this? The first step is to declare a new variable, to make BraneScript aware that it exists. The general syntax for this is:

```bscript
let <ID> := <EXPR>;
```

where `<ID>` is some identifier that you want to use for your variable (existing only of alphanumeric characters and an underscore, `_`), and `<EXPR>` is some code that _evaluates_ to a certain value. We've already seen an example of this: a function call is an expression, since it has a return value that we can pass to other functions or statements. Other expressions include _literal values_ (e.g., `true`, `42`, `3.14` or `"Hello, there!"`) or logical or mathmatical operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, logical conjunction, comparison, etc). For some more examples, see [below](./funcs-classes.md#arrays), or check the [BraneScript documentation](../../branescript/expressions.md) for a full overview.

Yet another example of an expression is a _variable reference_, which effectively reads a particular variable. To use it, simply specify the identifier of the variable you declared (`ID`) any time you can use an expression. For example:

```bscript
// Declare one variable with a value
let foo := 21 + 21;

// We can use it here to assign the same value to `bar`!
let bar := foo;
```

Finally, you can also update the value of a variable using similar syntax to a declaration:

```bscript
<ID> := <EXPR>;
```

(note the omission of the `let`).

This is known as an _assignment_, and can only be done on variables already declared. For example:

```bscript
// This will print '42'...
let foo := 42;
println(foo);

// ...and this will print '84'
foo := 84;
println(foo);
```

Technically, variables won't be updated until the expression is _evaluated_ (i.e., computed). This guaranteed ordering means that the following also works:

```bscript
// This works because foo is first read to compute `foo * 2`, and only then updated
let foo := 42;
foo := foo * 2;
// Foo is now 84
```

[^arrays]: You may already have guessed that Arrays or Classes may contain multiple variables themselves. However, arrays or classes are objects too; and while they can contain any number of nested values, we still consider them a single object themselves.

## Functions

Something that you've already seen used in the [previous chapter](./workflow.md) and the previous section, is the use of _function calls_.

This concept is used in almost any language, and essentially represents a temporary jump to some other part of code that is executed, and then the program continues from the function call onwards. Crucially, we typically allow these snippets to take in some values - _arguments_ - and hand us back a value when they are done - a _return value_.

BraneScript uses a syntax that is very widely used in languages like C, Python, Rust, Lua, C#, Java, ... It is defined as:

```bscript
<ID>( <ARG1>, <ARG2>, ... )
```

The `<ID>` is the identifier of the function (i.e., its name), and in between the parenthesis (`()`) there are zero or more arguments to pass to the function, separated by commas.

The return value of the function is returned "invisibly", in the sense that it is returned as a value in an expression. To illustrate this, consider the following function `zero` that simply returns the integer `0`:

```bscript
let zero := zero();
println(zero);   // Should print '0'
```

(It should be obvious now that `println` was a regular function call all along!)

To use expression language, we can say that a function will always evaluate to its return value. To this end, there is a strict ordering implied: first, BraneScript will evaluate all of the function's arguments (in-order), _then_ the function is called and executed, after which the remainder of the expression continues using the function's return value.

This makes it possible for us to write the following, which uses the `zero` function from the previous example and some `add`-function that takes two integers as its arguments and returns their sum:

```bscript
let fourty_two := add(add(add(2, add(zero(), 20)), zero()), 20);
println(fourty_two);   // Should print '42'
```

Note that BraneScript uses the same syntax for calling imported functions (see the [previous chapter](./workflow.md) with the `hello_world()`-function), builtin functions (think `println()`; see [below](#builtin-functions)) and defined functions (check the [relevant chapter](./funcs-classes.md)).

To be complete, you can import all of the functions within a package using the import-statement:

```bscript
import <id>;
```

You've already seen examples of this in the [previous chapter](./workflow.md).

## Control flow

Another very important and common feature of a programming language is that it typically has syntax for defining the _control flow_ of a language. In BraneScript, this is even more important, since effectively that is what a workflow is: defining some control flow for a set of function calls.

To that end, BraneScript supports different kind of statements that can allow your workflow to branch or loop, or define things such as where functions are executed.

In the following subsections, we will go through each of the control-flow statements currently supported.

### If-statements

Arguably one of the most important statements, an if-statement allows your code to take _one_ of two branches based on some condition. Most languages feature an if-statement, and most feature them in comparable syntax.

For BraneScript, this syntax is:

```bscript
if (<EXPR>) {
    <STATEMENTS>
}
```

This means that, if the `<EXPR>` evaluates to a `true`-boolean value, the code inside the block (i.e., the curly brackets `{}`) is executed; but if it evaluates to `false`, then it isn't.

An example of an if-statement is:

```bscript
// Let's assume this has an arbitrary value
let some_value := 42;

if (some_value == 42) {
    println("some_value was 42!");
}
```

Because the expression `value == 42` is computed at runtime, this allows the program to become flexible and respond differently to different values stored in variables.

The if-statement also comes in another form:

```bscript
if (<EXPR>) {
    <STATEMENTS>
} else {
    <OTHER-STATEMENTS>
}
```

This is known as an _if-else_-statement, and essentially has the same definition _except_ that, if the condition now evaluates to `false`, the second block of statements is run instead of nothing. To illustrate: these two blocks of code are equivalent:

```bscript
let some_value := 42;
if (some_value == 42) {
    println("some_value was 42!");
} else {
    println("some_value was not 42 :(");
}
```

```bscript
let some_value := 42;
if (some_value == 42) {
    println("some_value was 42!");
}
if (some_value != 42) {
    println("some_value was not 42 :(");
}
```

>
> ```c
> int some_value = 42;
> if (some_value == 42) {
>     printf("some_value was 42!");
> } else if (some_value == 43) {
>     printf("some_value was 43!");
> } else if (some_value == 44) {
>     printf("some_value was 44!");
> } else {
>     printf("some_value had some other value :(");
> }
> ```
>
> BraneScript, however, has no such syntax (yet). Instead, you should write the following to emulate the same behaviour:
>
> ```bscript
> let some_value := 42;
> if (some_value == 42) {
>     println("some_value was 42!");
> } else {
>     if (some_value == 43) {
>         println("some_value was 43!");
>     } else {
>         if (some_value == 44) {
>             println("some_value was 44!");
>         } else {
>             println("some_value had some other value :(");
>         }
>     }
> }
> ```
>
> Tedious, but produces equivalent results.

### For-loop

Another type of control-flow statement is a so-called _for-loop_. These repeat a piece of code multiple times, based on some specific kind of condition being true.

Let's start with the syntax:

```bscript
for (<STATEMENT>; <EXPR>; <STATEMENT>) {
    <STATEMENTS>
}
```

BraneScript for-loops are very similar to C for-loops, in that they have three parts (respectively):

- An _initializer_, which is a statement that is run once before any iteration;
- A _condition_, which is ran at the start of every iteration. The iteration continues if it evaluates to `true`, or else the loop quits;
- and an _increment_, which is a statement that is run at the end of every loop.

Typically, you use the initializer to initialize some variable, the condition to check if the variable has exceeded some bounds and the increment to increment the variable at the end of every iteration. For example:

```bscript
for (let i := 0; i < 10; i := i + 1) {
    println("Hello there!");
}
```

This will print the phrase `Hello there!` exactly 10 times.

> <img src="../../assets/img/info.png" alt="info" width="16" style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: -3px"/> Note that the syntax for for-loops might become a lot more restrictive in the future. This is because they are quite similar to while-loops the way they are now (see [below](#while-loop)), but without the advantage that the compiler can easily deduce the number of iterations that a loop does if it is statically available.

### While-loop

While loops are generalizations of for-loops, which repeat a piece of code multiple times as long as _some_ condition holds true. Essentially, they only define the _condition_-part of a for-loop; the initializer and increment are left open to be implemented as normal statements.

The syntax for a while-loop is as follows:

```bscript
while (<EXPR>) {
    <STATEMENTS>
}
```

The statements in the body of the while-loop are thus executed as long as the expression evaluates to `true`. Just as with the for-loop, this check happens at the _start_ of every iteration.

For example, we can emulate the same for-loop as above by writing the following:

```bscript
let i := 0;
while (i < 10) {
    println("Hello there!");
    i := i + 1;
}
```

More interestingly, we often represent a while-loop to do work that requires an unknown amount of iterations. A classic example would be to iterate while an error is larger than some factor:

```bscript
let err := 100.0;
while (err > 1.0) {
    train_some_network();
    err := compute_error();
}
```

(A real example would probably require arguments in the functions, but they are left out here for simplicity).

Finally, another common pattern, which is an infinite loop, can also most easily be written with while-loops:

```bscript
print("The");
while (true) {
    print(" end is never the");
}
```

Note, however, that BraneScript currently has no support for a `break`-statement (like you may find in other languages). Instead, use a simple boolean variable to iterate until you like to stop, or use a `return`-statement (see [the next chapter](./funcs-classes.md)).

### Parallel statements

A feature that is a bit more unique to BraneScript is a parallel-statement. Like if-statements, they have multiple branches, but instead of taking only one of them, _all_ of them are taken - in parallel.

The syntax for a parallel statement is:

```bscript
parallel [{
    <STATEMENTS>
}, {
    <MORE-STATEMENTS>
}, ...]
```

(Think of it as a list (`[]`) of one or more code blocks (`{}`))

Unlike the if-statement, a parallel-statement can have any number of branches. For example:

```bscript
parallel [{
    println("This is printed...");
}, {
    println("...while this is printed...");
}, {
    println("...at the same time this is printed!");
}]
```

There is more to say about parallel branches, but we keep this for the [chapter on advanced workflows](./advanced.md) since it mixes with other BraneScript features. For now, assume that the branches run in parallel are run in arbitrary order, and (conceptually) at the same time. Once every branch has completed, the workflow continues (i.e., the "end" of the parallel statement acts as a joining point).

## Builtin functions

Finally, it is very useful to know the builtin functions in BraneScript. These are them:

- `print(<string>)`: Prints the given string (or other value) to the terminal (stdout, to be precise). Does _not_ add a newline at the end of the string.
- `println(<string>)`: Prints the given string (or other value) to the terminal (stdout, to be precise). _Does_ add a newline at the end of the string.
- `len(<array>)`: Returns the length of the given array, as an integer.
- `commit_result(<string>, <result>)`: A function that promotes an intermediate result to a dataset. Don't worry if this doesn't make sense yet - for that, examine the [chapter on data](./data-results.md).

You've already seen `println` being used in this and the previous chapter, and that's also the builtin you will likely be using the most.

## Examples

To help grasping the presented concepts, we present the following workflow that uses a little bit of all of them:

```bscript
let hello := "Hello, world!";
println(hello);

hello := "Hello there!";
println(hello);

if (hello == "Hello, world!") {
    println("Goodbye, world!");
} else {
    println("Goodbye there!");
}

println("I love the world so much, I'm going to say hi...");
for (let i := 0; i < 5; i := i + 1) {
    println(i);
}
println("...times!");

println("In fact, I will say 'hi' until...");
let i := 0;
let say_hi := true;
while (say_hi) {
    i := i + 1;
    if (i == 3) { say_hi := false; }
    print("say_hi is ");
    print(say_hi);
    println("!");
}

parallel [{
    println("HELLO WORLD!");
}, {
    println("HELLO WORLD!");
}, {
    println("HELLO WORLD!");
}];
```

It may help to first try and guess what the workflow will print, and only then execute it to see if your guess was right.

## Next

If you have the idea you understand these basic constructs a little, congratulations! This should allow you to write basic workflows.

In the [next chapter](./funcs-classes.md), we examine how to define functions and classes and how to use the latter. Then, in the [chapter after that](./data-results.md), we examine BraneScript's builtin `Data`-class, which is integral to writing useful workflows. Finally, in the [last chapter](./advanced.md) of the BraneScript-part, we discuss some of the finer details of BraneScript as a language.

Separate from these introductory chapters, there is also the complete and more formal overview of the language in the [BraneScript documentation](../../branescript/introduction.md). Those chapters should cover all of its details, and function as useful reference material once you've grasped the basics.
