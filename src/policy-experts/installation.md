# Installation
As a policy expert, you will write policies and then manage them in the node's `brane-chk`-service.

To do the former, you need a development environment for the reasoner backend you will be using. See the [Installing the eFLINT Interpreter](#installing-the-eflint-interpreter)-section to find out how to setup a local environment for eFLINT.

For the latter, you can choose between the [Policy Reasoner GUI](https://github.com/braneframework/policy-reasoner-gui), a visual interface, or `branectl`, a command-line interface. Installing either of these is explained in [Installing management tools](#installing-management-tools)-section.


## Installing the eFLINT Interpreter
To develop and test your policies, it is recommended to have an offline environment available where you can iteratively test your policies as you construct them.

The most mature eFLINT interpreter is the [Haskell implementation](https://gitlab.com/eflint/haskell-implementation). This version is up-to-date with the most recent eFLINT edition, and supports a human-friendly REPL to examine and change a knowledge base for testing purposes.

To install it, download and install [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) as described in the [README](https://gitlab.com/eflint/haskell-implementation/#installation) of the project. In short, open a terminal and run:
```bash
# On Ubuntu
apt-get install cabal-install ghc
cabal update
```

Once installed, clone the repository with the interpreter and build it with `cabal`:
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/eflint/haskell-implementation ./eflint
cd eflint
cabal configure
cabal build
cabal install
```

After completion, you should be able to run the interactive eFLINT prompt by running:
```bash
eflint-repl
```

Use `eflint-repl --help` to see more options, or type `:help` when you are in the REPL.

Also consider adding syntax highlighting for your favourite code editor. There are syntax highlighters for [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Lut99/eflint-syntax-highlighting) and [Sublime](https://gitlab.com/eflint/haskell-implementation/-/blob/master/eflint.sublime-syntax?ref_type=heads).


## Installing management tools
To manage the local Brane node, you need to use a tool that can interface with the reasoner and push/pull policies, change the active policy and test drive your changes. Currently, there are two tools available that can do this:
1. The official [Policy Reasoner GUI](https://github.com/braneframework/policy-reasoner-gui), which provides a visual interface; and
2. The Brane CTL management tool, which provides a terminal interface.

Installing the first is recommended in most cases, except when you're in need of a quick way to manage them (e.g., in scenarios where the system administrator also takes the role of the policy expert) or are more comfortable with terminals in general.

### The Policy Reasoner GUI
The most up-to-date instructions for installing the policy reasoner GUI are described [here](https://github.com/braneframework/policy-reasoner-gui/blob/main/README.md). Below follows a summary for convenience.

First, clone the repository to your machine using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/braneframework/policy-reasoner-gui && cd ./policy-reasoner-gui
```
Then, you can either install the GUI natively or in a Docker container.

For the former, install [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) ([rustup](https://rustup.rs) is usually the easiest) and [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm/). Then, open two terminals in the repository directory, and run
```bash
cd client
npx parcel
```
in one to launch the HTML client, and
```
cargo run
```
in the other to launch the client's backend.

---
For the latter, install [Docker](https://docker.com) ([macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/), [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/), [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/) or [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/docker)) (don't forget to enable [sudoless access](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) if you're on Linux). Then, run:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
to build & run both the client and the client's backend.


### The `branectl` management tool
To install the management tool, you can download the binary from the [repository](https://github.com/BraneFramework/brane) or compile it from scratch.

To download, you simply go to the [release](https://github.com/BraneFramework/brane/releases/latest) and download the `branectl` binary of your choice. There are options to download it for Linux ([`branectl-linux-x86_64`](https://github.com/BraneFramework/brane/releases/latest/download/branectl-linux-x86_64)), Intel Macs ([`branectl-darwin-x86_64`](https://github.com/BraneFramework/brane/releases/latest/download/branectl-darwin-x86_64)) or M1/M2/M3 Macs ([`branectl-darwin-aarch64`](https://github.com/BraneFramework/brane/releases/latest/download/branectl-darwin-aarch64)).

To compile the binary yourself, install [GCC's `gcc` and `g++`](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) ([rustup](https://rustup.rs) is usually the easiest) first if you haven't already. Then, clone the repository and run the `make.py` script:
```
git clone https://github.com/BraneFramework/brane && cd ./brane
./make.py ctl
```
The resulting binary can be found under `target/release/branectl`.

Either way, it's nice if you add the binary to your PATH to make executing it easier. To do so, you can copy it to `/usr/local/bin` on Linux or macOS:
```bash
sudo cp <BINARY_PATH> /usr/local/bin/branectl
```
If you can execute `branectl --help` without problems, you know the installation succeeded.


## Next
Now that you have the management client of your choice installed, move to the [next chapter](./management.md) to learn how to use it.

You can also consult chapters on how to write [eFLINT policies](./eflint/introduction.md), if that's the language of your node, or else how to [write new backends](./backend/introduction.md).
